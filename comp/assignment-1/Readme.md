- TODO: at 'assignment-1' directory when use `make run` command, it should start

Assignment Instructions:

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Program Specification
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this assignemnt you will be writing a C++?SFML program which will read
descriptions of shapes form a configuration file, and then drawing those shapes
to the screen. Each shape will have a name, position, speed, color, as well as 
properties unique to each shape type. For example, a REctangle will have width 
and height, and a circle will have a Radius. For this assignment, the position
of a shape refers to its SFML default of the upper-left corner of the shape.

You are also required to make these shapes "bounce" off the sides of the window 
wchich contains them. This means that if the shape's left sidse hits the left side
of the window, its Y speed reverses. Similiaryly, if it hits the right side or bottom of
the window. You can assume that all shapes will always be configured to start 
entirely within the window, and you don't have to worry about what happens if 
they start outside the window. Each shape's name should be drawn on the exact
center of the shape in the given font size and color specified in the config file.
(Note: this may be the trickiest part of the assignment, you will not lose 
many makrs if it's not hte exact center)


You are also required to implement an ImGui user interface which is able to:
- List all of the shapes and select any one of them to edit their properties
- Toggle whether or not the selected shape will be drawn
- Change the scale of the shape (0 to 4)
- Change the x and y velocity of the shape (-8 to 8)
- Change the color of the shape
- Change the name of the shape

UI Note: Do not worry if rapidly changing the scale parameter causes the
         shape to go outside the bounds of the rectangle. Assume that it will
         only be changed to remain within the rectangle. The newly scaled
         shape should properly bounce with its new size.

A sample configuration file is given to you in config.txt, however marking will
be done with an unseen configuration file in order to test more completely. Be
sure to add and remove your own shapes to this file to test if they all work.

Each line of the config fiel specifies one of the config settings of the 
assignment program, with the first string in each line being the type of setting
that the rest of the line specififed. Lines in the config file can be one of the 
following types, and lines can appear in any order in the file.

Window W H
- This line declares that the SFML Window myst be constructed 
    with width W and height H, each of which will be integers

Font F S R G B
- This lines defines the font which is to be used to draw text 
    for this program. The format of the line is as follows: 
    Font File       F           std::string (it will have no spaces)
    Font Size       S           int
    RGB Color       (R,G,B)     int, int, int

Rectangle N X Y SX SY R G B W H
- Defines a RectangleShape with:
Shape Name          Name        std::string
Initial Position    (X,Y)       float, float
Initial Speed       (SX,SY)     float, float
RGB Color           (R,G,B)     int, int, int
Size                (W,H)       float, float

Circle N X Y SX SY R G B R
- Defines a CircleShape with:
Shape Name          N           std::string
Initial Position    (X,Y)       float, float
Initial Speed       (SX,SY)     float, float
RGB Color           (R,G,B)     int, int, int
Radius              R           float

Assignment Hints
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- In order to store an arbitrary number of shapes from the configuration file,
  you must store them in a container â€” std::vector is recommended.

- Consider creating a custom class or struct which stores all of the properties
  of a shape that are not stored within the sf::Shape class itself
  example: velocity, name, etc

- A shape will 'touch' the side of the window if its bounding box makes
  contact with it. Each shape's bounding rectangle can be obtained via:

shape.getLocalBounds(); // .top, .left, .width, .height
  - gives the LOCAL position of the (top, left) of the rectangle
  - LOCAL pos means it is relative to shape.getPosition(), not the window
  - as well as the (width, height) size of the rectangle

shape.getGlobalBounds() will take into account any scale, translation, etc
  that has been applied to the shape. May be useful for the ui scaling

- Similarly, a sf::Text element's bounding rectangle can also be
  retrieved via text.getLocalBounds(), which you will need to use to
  center the text properly within a shape.

- Please use C++ file reading (std::ifstream makes this easy) rather
  than C-style FILE reading. You will lose marks for using older C functions!
